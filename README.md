<h3><img align="center" height="30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9129e5a6-8194-41c3-ac4c-6a93b512304e"> Mai is a Large-Language-model-based Minecraft plugin intended to add NPCs that can act as a substitute for players. This will allow for “multiplayer” Minecraft to be played at large scales without having many friends or trusting strangers with access to your world.
