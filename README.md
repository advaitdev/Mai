# Mai (*M*inecraft *A*rtificial *I*ntelligence)

Mai is a Large-Language-model-based Minecraft plugin intended to add NPCs that can act as a substitute for players. This will allow for “multiplayer” Minecraft to be played at large scales without having many friends or trusting strangers with access to your world.
